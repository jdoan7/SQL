# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#After inserting the data, I explored the it using the following SQL.

#First I listed the top 5 artists that are the most popular and easiest to dance to.
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS popular, AVG(danceability) as dance
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popular DESC, dance DESC
LIMIT 5;

#Then I wanted to determine what are the 10 most popular songs.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Lastly I wanted to know what the average duration (in miliseconds) for songs by Olivia Rodrigo is.
SELECT AVG(duration_ms) AS avg_duration
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo';
